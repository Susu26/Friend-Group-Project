# FriendGroup - Social Media App

Different to any other Social Media App, this application helps you to stay in contact with your friends, rather than connecting to new people.

## Features
  
- **Group Chat:** A group chat designed to stay in touch and make plans. Similar to WhatsApp group chat but tailored to the needs of close friend groups.
  
- **Group Notes:** A group chat designed to stay in touch and make plans. Similar to WhatsApp group chat but tailored to the needs of close friend groups.
  
- **Group Calender:** A group chat designed to stay in touch and make plans. Similar to WhatsApp group chat but tailored to the needs of close friend groups.

## In Development (MVP)

- **Quarkus Backend:** A stable Posgres database is managed using the Hibernate Panache ORM. The client server communication is handled using a REST API and vanilla WebSockets for real time chat.

- **Frontend:** Uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to provide a user-friendly interface.

## Future Features

- **Combine seperate Frontend(s):** Combine the, for now seperate, web applications for the diffrent features into one app.

- **Location Map:** A map view to see where your friends are currently located.

- **User System:** User/Authentication system implemented using Keycloak an Open Source Identity and Access Management.
