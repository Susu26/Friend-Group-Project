# <span style="color:teal;">FriendGroup - Social Media App</span>

**<span style="color:#6487a8;">"Stay in touch rather than connect from scratch"**</span>

## Introduction
Welcome to our project where our key focus is on maintaining deep friendships, rather than starting the process of a new friendship from scratch over and over again.

## Usage
Clone the repository and open the index.html in the frontend public folder.

In order to enter the chat you have to create a username. In the chat you can send the messages and your friends in the group can read them.

## Features

- **Create Friend Groups:** Create your "FriendGroup" or be added to your friends "FriendGroup".
  
- **Group Chat:** A group chat designed to stay in touch and make plans. Similar to WhatsApp group chat but tailored to the needs of close friend groups.

## In Development (MVP)

- **Node.js Backend:** Utilizes a .json file that acts like a database to store group chat messages.

- **Frontend:** Uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to provide a user-friendly interface.

## Future Features

- **Shared Notes:** The ability to share notes with the friend group.

- **Location Map:** A map view to see where your friends are currently located.
