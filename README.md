# FriendGroup - Social Media App

Different to any other Social Media App, this application helps you to stay in contact with your friends, rather than connecting to new people.

## Features

- **Create Friend Groups:** Create your "FriendGroup" or be added to your friends "FriendGroup".
  
- **Group Chat:** A group chat designed to stay in touch and make plans. Similar to WhatsApp group chat but tailored to the needs of close friend groups.

## In Development (MVP)

- **Node.js Backend:** Utilizes a .json file that acts like a database to store group chat messages.

- **Frontend:** Uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to provide a user-friendly interface.

## Future Features

- **Shared Notes:** The ability to share notes with the friend group.

- **Location Map:** A map view to see where your friends are currently located.

## Contributors

This project is developed by an agile team of 6 software developers and designers using the Scrum methodology.
